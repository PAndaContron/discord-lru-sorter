# Discord LRU Sorter Bot

This bot automatically sorts the channels and categories in your server based on how recently they've been used (had a message sent).
More recently used channels go to the top of the category, and more recently used categories go to the top of the channel list.

## Setup

First, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (you may need to change `pip` to something else like `pip3` depending on your system).
Then, you can run the `config.py` script and follow the instructions to configure the bot.
Finally, run `main.py` to actually run the bot.
